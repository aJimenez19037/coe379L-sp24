From the Syllabus 
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Catalog Description:**

Covers design, implementation, operation and assurance of intelligent software systems based on data intensive 
computing and machine learning techniques. Course materials and assignments will 
utilize real-world datasets from engineering disciplines.

**Prerequisites:**

Computational Engineering 332 with a grade of at least C-.


**Knowledge, Skills, and Abilities Students Should Have Before Entering This Course:**

This course assumes knowledge of the Python programming language (data structures, conditionals, 
loops, and functions), software design, distributed systems, and asynchronous programming (concurrent 
programming, tasks queues, microservice architectures, etc). We also assume knowledge of Multivariate 
Calculus and Linear Algebra as well as a basic, working knowledge of the Linux command line. We 
will not introduce/cover basic programming skills or debugging. Ultimately, each student is expected 
to be able to write and debug working Python programs and to have experience designing larger systems 
as a composition of smaller components. This is not an introductory programming class nor an introductory 
design class; we will not have time to help students debug their programs.


**Knowledge, Skills, and Abilities Students Gain from this Course (Learning Outcomes):**

The objective of this course is to introduce students to scalable data analysis and machine learning 
techniques for designing, implementing, validating and operating responsible intelligent systems. 
The course covers algorithms, techniques and tools for applying data analytics and machine 
learning to real-world problems. Through a series of projects spanning the course of the semester, 
students design and implement responsible, intelligent computational systems. The course strikes 
a balance between foundational and state-of-the-art techniques.

**Project Assignments**
Four multi-week projects assigned throughout the semester will cover the topics presented in the 
course. Students will be allowed to work alone or with one other student on projects; however, each student 
group must write up and submit their own solution, including code their own programs and write their own 
documentation. Students are not allowed to submit duplicates of other students’ work.

**Attendance**
Regular attendance is expected but absences will not count against the student’s grade. We expect 
students to give us a week's notice in advance of their absence if known ahead of time.
