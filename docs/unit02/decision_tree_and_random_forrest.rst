 Decision Tree and Random Forrest
 ================================

In this module we introduce the Decision Tree and Random Forrest classifiers. We discuss 
general guidelines for when to use each. Finally, we show how to implement 
Decision Tree and Random Forrest classifiers using sklearn.

By the end of this module, students should be able to:

1. Describe how the Decision Tree and Random Forrest classifier models work 
   at a high level.
2. Describe when each model is most appropriate to use (and why).
3. Implement each using the sklearn package.
